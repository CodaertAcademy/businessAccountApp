# businessAccountApp

# This project is part of the curriculum of a Codaert Academy Course on JavaScript Web Development and has been given to a student of the course in order to test his prominence in the course of study so far.

A business Account App built with cloud firestore


Using the tools bootstrap, sass and Cloud Firestore, design a functioning business Account App

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many small businesses are having difficulty keeping track of how much they spend in their businesses or how much income they have made so far. We want you to build a small webApp solution that would combat this issue on ground.

- The accountApp will have an authentication page.
- Users can input their expenses, income, debts and loans (be aware that loans are both incomes and debts because they provide the user with money he can spend on his business but they'd have to be refunded to the creditor and sometimes with interest).
- Each entry will have a day, month and year of entry input field because the user will also be given a monthly report of how much money he made, spent, owes and loaned.
- The user will also be shown a total of how much he's made, spent, owed and loaned since the beginning of the business.
- When debts are paid off (partially or completely), the user can input how much was paid off, this will update both his expenses and his owing section of the app.

Hint
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Any fintech solution like cowrywise, bank apps, piggybank is an example to follow.
- You are free to either make this a one-page webapp or a multiple page webapp.
